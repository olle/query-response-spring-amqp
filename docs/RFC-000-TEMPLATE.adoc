= Title

== Summary

One paragraph explanation of the change.

== Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What problems does it
solve? What is the expected outcome?

== Design Details

_This is the bulk of the RFC._

Introduce and explain new concepts. It should be reasonably clear how the
proposal would be implemented. Provide representative examples that show how
this proposal would be commonly used. Corner cases should be dissected by
example.

== Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

== Rationale and Alternatives

This is your chance to discuss your proposal in the context of the whole design
space. This is probably the most important section! Why is this design the best
in the space of possible designs? What other designs have been considered and
what is the rationale for not choosing them? What is the impact of not doing
this?

== Unresolved issues

What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process
before this gets merged?

What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation
of this feature?

What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be
addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of
this RFC?
