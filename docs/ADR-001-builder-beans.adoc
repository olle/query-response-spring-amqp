= Builder Beans

== Status

Accepted.

== Context

There's an idiomatic way of providing library functionality throughout Spring.
Modules such as Spring JDBC, AMQP or Web provide _templates_ as beans. Users
can have these templates injected into their components, and access the
functionality.

Publishing the Query/Response API through static factory methods, may be
convenient but **it is not the common way.** It also hides the capabilities
of _mock_ or _test dummy_ setup in the user code, which makes testing harder.

== Decision

The `QueryBuilder` and `ResponseBuilder` should both be made available through
the means of bean injection. The static factory methods are removed.

The beans shall be available as mockable types, to better support testing.

== Consequences

A lot of complexity caused by static access to the registry beans, will
disappear.

The convenient and very terse static API is no longer available.

Testing is much easier for users.
