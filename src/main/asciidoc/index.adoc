_Sometime around 2015 I came across a presentation with {1010}[Fred George],
 about the {1020}[Challenges in Implementing Microservices]. It's a great
 talk, with lots of good and relevant information. Experience comes from
 learning through failures, and at this point in time I sure had learned about
 the problem with distributed services and blocking API calls. I had seen how
 latencies would go up and availability go down the drain, as calls from
 service A to B were actually depending on service B calling service C, calling
 service D. It was a mess._

_In his talk {1010}[George] lands at the question "Synchronous or Asynchronous?"
 and proceeds to describe, what he calls, the "Needs Pattern". Service A would,
 instead of calling service B, publish a **query**, and service B would be
 able to pick it up and send back a **response**. After hearing this I began to
 think a lot about the effects of moving to asynchronous communication between
 services. There was clearly a lot more there than just decoupling. Something
 more profound._

_The **Query/Response** pattern, that I arrived at, challenges developers to
 really think hard about the responsibilities and autonomy of services. It
 provides very few guarantees, which will force decisions around resilience
 and availability at a much earlier stage in the design and development process.
 It literally turns things around - an inversion of responsibility - which I
 truly believe we can benefit from._

== About This Document

This document is intended to work as a comprehensive reference for developers.
It provides an introduction to the technical prerequisites, and how to get
started. We present the Monitoring UI and describe its features and benefits.
There is a deep-dive into the `QueryBuilder` and `ResponseBuilder`, which is
aimed at describing their capabilities.

As the last chapter we've placed the description of Query/Response as a pattern
for service integration, along with a small formal protocol description. For
readers new to Query/Response we would advice to go ahead and read that chapter
first.
