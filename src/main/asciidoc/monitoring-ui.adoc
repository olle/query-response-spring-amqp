= Monitoring UI

include::attributes.adoc[]

{qr-name} is intended to be used in a landscape of distributed and highly
decoupled services that exchange information and data. Being able to monitor and
observe that is very important. We provide a monitoring and administration
user interface for this purpose.

The latest built version of the {qr-ui-name} can be downloaded as a fat-jar
from {qr-ui-link}[{qr-ui-link}]. To start {qr-ui-name} simply run:

....
$ java -jar query-response-ui.jar
....

== Overview

The {qr-ui-name} connects to the RabbitMQ broker and **uses Query/Response**
to query for information about the live nodes in the current system setup. It
is available at http://localhost:8080 after starting up.

Since we are _eating our own dog food_ we get a very nice effect, where the
{qr-ui-name} instance is self-visualizing - it shows up as a live-node.

=== Three Golden Metrics

The {qr-ui-name} lets us learn about the currently running system. The top most
part provides a few base metrics - our initial _golden three:_ success rate,
latency and throughput.

.Overview Metrics
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| Success Rate (**SR**)
| `percent`
| The rate of _successful_ queries performed. A query is successful if it
  returns results, which means any predicates, limits or timeouts are also
  successfully evaluated.
| **SR** Queries   | `number` | The current known count of published queries.
| **SR** Responses | `number` | The current known count of consumed responses.
| **SR** Fallbacks | `number` | The current known count of executed fallbacks.

| Latency (**L**)
| `duration`
| The average measured time for either a query or a response to be published,
  and then consumed. The _transport_ duration.
| **L** Min   | `duration` | The current measured shortest, non zero, latency duration.
| **L** Max   | `duration` | The current measured longest latency duration.

| Throughput (**TP**)
| `rate`
| The current measured query and response message publishing rate. _Measured
  over a fixed sample size window._
| **TP** Queries   | `rate` | The current measured message publishing rate, for queries.
| **TP** Responses | `rate` | The current measured message publishing rate, for responses.

=== Live Nodes

The second section shows some information about the current _live nodes_, which
means any clients using {qr-name}, that are currently up and running.

.Live Nodes
|===
| Column | Description

| Name         | The {spring-boot-name} app name, or `application` if it could not be resolved.
| Pid          | The `pid` of the client Java process, or `-` if it could not be resolved.
| Address      | Host name or IP address, or `unknown` if it could not be resolved.
| Uptime       | The app uptime, or `-` if it could not be determined.
| Success Rate | Rate of successful queries (**SR**), or `-` in case the client is only publishing responses.
| Responses    |Â Number of published responses (including statistics for the {qr-ui-name}).
| Latency      | Measured latency for queries and responses, the _transport_ duration (**L**).
| Throughput   | Publishing rate for queries and responses (**TP**).
