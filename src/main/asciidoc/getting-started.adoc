= Getting Started

include::attributes.adoc[]

{qr-name} makes it really easy to extend {spring-boot-name} stand-alone,
production-grade applications, that are using {spring-amqp-name}. We have taken
a working pattern for building highly decoupled evolving service architectures,
and wrapped it in a developer friendly library.

== System Requirements

{qr-name-and-version} requires at least {spring-boot-name-and-version} and
{java-name-and-version}, and should work for later releases too.

:Maven: https://maven.apache.org
:Gradle: https://gradle.org

It is distributed as a {Maven}[Maven] dependency, and is known to work well with
Maven 3.3+. Using the dependency with {Gradle}[Gradle] should work too.

:Quickstart: https://github.com/olle/query-response-spring-amqp#quickstart

The current {Quickstart}[Quickstart] information, available on the projects
{qr-gh-link}[Github page], provides a short snippet on the currently best way
to add the Maven dependency.

== Installation

Enabling {qr-name} is done by loading the `QueryResponseConfiguration` class.
The most simple way to do this, is annotating your {spring-boot-name}
application starter with the `@EnableQueryResponse` annotation.

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-src}/myapp/src/main/java/app/MyApp.java[tags=install]
----

NOTE: This annotation will do nothing more but to import the
      `QueryResponseConfiguration` class.

Before you can run your application you need to make sure there is an AMQP
broker available. By default {spring-amqp-name} tries to connect to a
https://www.rabbitmq.com[RabbitMQ], running locally on port `5672`.

Add the following `docker-compose.yaml` file to your project root directory.

[source,yaml]
----
include::{examples-src}/myapp/docker-compose.yaml[]
----

NOTE: The `3-management` tag will install and enable the RabbitMQ Management UI.
      When then broker is running, it can be access at http://localhost:15672
      with username and password `guest`.

Using https://www.docker.com[Docker] you can start a RabbitMQ instance running
_detached_ (`-d` option), in the background, in a container.

....
$ docker-compose up -d
....

Now starting your application, will enable {qr-name} and create all the
resources necessary on the broker.

....
$ mvn spring-boot:run
....

Now is a good time to use the RabbitMQ Management UI, available at
http://localhost:15672, to inspect the exchange, queues and bindings created
by {qr-name} by default.

== Queries

Publishing **queries** is a way for your application to ask for information that
it may need in order to accomplish tasks. {qr-name} makes this really really 
easy, using the `QueryBuilder`.

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-src}/myapp/src/main/java/app/Queries.java[tags=query]
----
<1> Initiates a query for the term `marco`, expecting results of the type
    `String.class` to be returned. The return type is always aggregated in a
    collection. Either **none, one or many** responses may be returned.

<2> Queries require a timeout, here we set it to `1000L` milliseconds. This
    means that this specific query will **always** block for 1 second.

<3> The query may not receive any responses, so it _always_ needs to specify
    how that case should be handled. Default here is an empty collection, of
    the declared return type `String.class`.

====
Hopefully this shows you, how concise and powerful the `QueryBuilder` is,
dealing with results mapping, fault tolerance and default values, in just a
couple of lines of code.
====

If you run the application now, it will publish a **query** to the message
broker, which we can see in the logs.

....
$ mvn spring-boot:run
  ...
c.s.queryresponse.RabbitFacade           : |<-- Published query: marco - (Body:'{}' MessageProperties [headers={x-qr-published=1589642002076}, replyTo=94f0fff4-c4f3-4491-831d-00809edb6f95, contentType=application/json, contentLength=2, deliveryMode=NON_PERSISTENT, priority=0, deliveryTag=0])
....

At the moment there are no responses to be consumed, so after blocking for 1
second, nothing is printed `STDOUT`.

== Responses

Building services, medium, large or _micro_ (who cares), that publish
**responses** to queries is also really easy with {qr-name}, using the
`ResponseBuilder`.

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-src}/myapp/src/main/java/app/Responses.java[tags=response]
----

Now if you run the application again, with the response component registered
before the query publisher, it will publish the response.

....
$ mvn spring-boot:run
  ...
c.s.queryresponse.RabbitFacade           : |<-- Published query: marco - (Body:'{}' MessageProperties [headers={x-qr-published=1589642489894}, replyTo=c77a8a1d-c959-4f2a-bd51-85b7e6b5b69b, contentType=application/json, contentLength=2, deliveryMode=NON_PERSISTENT, priority=0, deliveryTag=0])
c.s.queryresponse.Response               : |--> Consumed query: marco
c.s.queryresponse.RabbitFacade           : |<-- Published response: c77a8a1d-c959-4f2a-bd51-85b7e6b5b69b - (Body:'{"elements":["polo","yolo"]}' MessageProperties [headers={x-qr-published=1589642489941}, contentType=application/json, contentEncoding=UTF-8, contentLength=28, deliveryMode=NON_PERSISTENT, priority=0, deliveryTag=0])
c.s.queryresponse.Query                  : |--> Received response message: MessageProperties [headers={x-qr-published=1589642489941}, contentType=application/json, contentEncoding=UTF-8, contentLength=0, receivedDeliveryMode=NON_PERSISTENT, priority=0, redelivered=false, receivedExchange=, receivedRoutingKey=c77a8a1d-c959-4f2a-bd51-85b7e6b5b69b, deliveryTag=1, consumerTag=amq.ctag-Q_ghWp4TWU9EYhi_rqErcg, consumerQueue=c77a8a1d-c959-4f2a-bd51-85b7e6b5b69b]
marco? polo
marco? yolo
....

Now you can see a full roundtrip of the **query** being published and consumed,
and the **response** being published and also consumed. And the finished output
is "polo" and "yolo" printed on `STDOUT`.

NOTE: We are using the `@Order` annotation in our example only to ensure that
      responses are built and registered before queries, when they are built
      in one and the same app.

== Monitoring UI

{qr-name} is intended to be used in a landscape of distributed and highly
decoupled services that exchange information and data. Being able to monitor and
observe that is very important.

We provide a monitoring and administration user interface for this purpose.

TODO: Add link to distributed JAR.

....
$ java -jar query-response-ui.jar
....

The {qr-ui-name} connects to the RabbitMQ broker and **uses Query/Response**
to query for information about the live nodes in the current system setup. It
is available at http://localhost:8080 after starting up.

Since we are _eating our own dog food_ we get a very nice effect, where the
{qr-ui-name} instance is self-visualizing - it shows up as a live-node.
