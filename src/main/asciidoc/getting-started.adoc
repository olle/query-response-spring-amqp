{qr-name} makes it really easy to extend {spring-boot-name} stand-alone,
production-grade Applications, that are using {spring-amqp-name}. We have taken
a working pattern for building highly decoupled evolving service architectures,
and wrapped it in a developer friendly library.

== System Requirements

{qr-name-and-version} requires at least {spring-boot-name-and-version} and
{java-name-and-version}, and should work for later releases too.

:Maven: https://maven.apache.org
:Gradle: https://gradle.org

It is distributed as a {Maven}[Maven] dependency, and is known to work well with
Maven 3.3+. Using the Maven dependency with {Gradle}[Gradle] should work too.
