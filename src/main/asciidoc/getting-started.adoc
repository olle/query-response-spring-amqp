{qr-name} makes it really easy to extend {spring-boot-name} stand-alone,
production-grade applications, that are using {spring-amqp-name}. We have taken
a working pattern for building highly decoupled evolving service architectures,
and wrapped it in a developer friendly library.

== System Requirements

{qr-name-and-version} requires at least **{spring-boot-name-and-version}** and
**{java-name-and-version}**, and should work for later releases too. We are
building and running it successfully with the `2.2.9.RELEASE` version.

:Maven: https://maven.apache.org
:Gradle: https://gradle.org

It is distributed as a {Maven}[Maven] dependency, and is known to work well with
Maven 3.3+. Using the dependency with {Gradle}[Gradle] should work too.

:Quickstart: https://github.com/olle/query-response-spring-amqp#quickstart

The current {Quickstart}[Quickstart] information, available on the projects
{qr-gh-link}[Github page], provides a short snippet on the currently best way
to add the Maven dependency.

== Installation

Enabling {qr-name} is done by simply loading the `QueryResponseConfiguration`
class. The most simple way to do this, is annotating your {spring-boot-name}
application starter with the `@EnableQueryResponse` annotation.

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-src}/myapp/src/main/java/app/MyApp.java[tags=install]
----

NOTE: This annotation will do nothing more but to import the
      `QueryResponseConfiguration` class.

That's it! There is no more infrastructure code, wiring or setup that needs to
be done. **It's just that easy.**

Before you can run your application you need to make sure there is an AMQP
broker available. By default {spring-amqp-name} tries to connect to a
https://www.rabbitmq.com[RabbitMQ], running locally on port `5672`.

Add the following `docker-compose.yaml` file to your project root directory.

[source,yaml]
----
include::{examples-src}/myapp/docker-compose.yaml[]
----

NOTE: The `3-management` tag will install and enable the RabbitMQ Management UI.
      When then broker is running, it can be access at http://localhost:15672
      with username and password `guest`.

Using https://www.docker.com[Docker] you can start a RabbitMQ instance running
_detached_ (`-d` option), in the background, in a container.

....
$ docker-compose up -d
....

Now starting your application, will enable {qr-name} and create all the
resources necessary on the broker.

....
$ mvn spring-boot:run
....

Now is a good time to use the RabbitMQ Management UI, available at
http://localhost:15672, to inspect the exchange, queues and bindings created
by {qr-name} by default.

== Queries

Publishing **queries** is a way for your application to ask for information that
it may need in order to accomplish tasks. Queries express a _need_, and are not
addressed to any specific service or component.

{qr-name} makes it really really easy, to create and publish a query using
the `QueryBuilder`.

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-src}/myapp/src/main/java/app/Queries.java[tags=query]
----
<1> Initiates a query for the term `marco`, with any results being consumed as,
    or _mapped_ to, the type `String.class`. Returned results are always
    gathered in a collection. Either **none, one or many** elements may be
    returned.

<2> Queries require a timeout, here we set it to `1000L` milliseconds. This
    means that this specific query will **always** block for 1 second.

<3> The query may not receive any responses, so it _always_ needs to specify
    how that case should be handled. Default here is an empty collection, of
    the declared return type `String.class`.

====
Hopefully this shows, how concise and powerful the `QueryBuilder` is, dealing
with results mapping, fault tolerance and default values in just a couple of
lines of code.
====

If you run the application now, it will publish a **query** to the message
broker, which we can see in the logs.

....
$ mvn spring-boot:run
  ...
c.s.queryresponse.RabbitFacade           : |<-- Published query: marco - (Body:'{}' MessageProperties [headers={x-qr-published=1589642002076}, replyTo=94f0fff4-c4f3-4491-831d-00809edb6f95, contentType=application/json, contentLength=2, deliveryMode=NON_PERSISTENT, priority=0, deliveryTag=0])
....

At the moment there are no responses to be consumed, so after blocking for 1
second, nothing is printed `STDOUT`.

== Responses

Building services, medium, large or _micro_ (who cares), that publish
**responses** to queries is also really easy with {qr-name}, using the
`ResponseBuilder`.

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-src}/myapp/src/main/java/app/Responses.java[tags=response]
----
<1> Initializes a response to queries for `marco`, providing the type-hint on
    how to map entries in the response. Set to `String.class` here.

<2> The response `withAll()` will publish all elements in one single response.

<3> And finally this response is provided the elements `"polo", "yolo"` as the
    actual data to publish. _The builder varags method, used here, is mostly
    for trying out {qr-name}, or for static responses._

====
Again, the builder makes it really easy to create a responding service, without
any special setup or complicated configurations.
====

Now if you run the application again, with the response component registered
before the query publisher, it will publish the response.

....
$ mvn spring-boot:run
  ...
c.s.queryresponse.RabbitFacade           : |<-- Published query: marco - (Body:'{}' MessageProperties [headers={x-qr-published=1589642489894}, replyTo=c77a8a1d-c959-4f2a-bd51-85b7e6b5b69b, contentType=application/json, contentLength=2, deliveryMode=NON_PERSISTENT, priority=0, deliveryTag=0])
c.s.queryresponse.Response               : |--> Consumed query: marco
c.s.queryresponse.RabbitFacade           : |<-- Published response: c77a8a1d-c959-4f2a-bd51-85b7e6b5b69b - (Body:'{"elements":["polo","yolo"]}' MessageProperties [headers={x-qr-published=1589642489941}, contentType=application/json, contentEncoding=UTF-8, contentLength=28, deliveryMode=NON_PERSISTENT, priority=0, deliveryTag=0])
c.s.queryresponse.Query                  : |--> Received response message: MessageProperties [headers={x-qr-published=1589642489941}, contentType=application/json, contentEncoding=UTF-8, contentLength=0, receivedDeliveryMode=NON_PERSISTENT, priority=0, redelivered=false, receivedExchange=, receivedRoutingKey=c77a8a1d-c959-4f2a-bd51-85b7e6b5b69b, deliveryTag=1, consumerTag=amq.ctag-Q_ghWp4TWU9EYhi_rqErcg, consumerQueue=c77a8a1d-c959-4f2a-bd51-85b7e6b5b69b]
marco? polo
marco? yolo
....

Now you can see a full roundtrip of the **query** being published and consumed,
and the **response** being published and also consumed. And the finished output
is "polo" and "yolo" printed on `STDOUT`.

NOTE: We are using the `@Order` annotation in our example only to ensure that
      responses are built and registered before queries, when they are built
      in one and the same app.
