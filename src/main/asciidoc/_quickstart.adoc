== Quickstart

The Query/Response library can easily be added to any Spring BootÂ® project, as
a single dependency.

```xml
  <dependency>
    <!-- From Jitpack-repo -->
    <groupId>com.github.olle</groupId>
    <artifactId>query-response-spring-amqp</artifactId>
    <version>${SOME-TAG}</version>
  </dependency>
```

_At the current time we recommend using https://jitpack.io[Jitpack] to resolve
the dependency. Query/Response will however be published to the Sonatype OSS 
repository and Maven Central in the future._

=== `@EnableQueryResponse`

:QueryResponseConfiguration: link:./src/main/java/com/studiomediatech/queryresponse/QueryResponseConfiguration.java

To initialize the Query/Response library resources, and load the
{QueryResponseConfiguration}[`QueryResponseConfiguration`] class, the
`@EnableQueryResponse` annotation can simply be added to any Spring Boot 
application starter.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableQueryResponse
public class App {
  ...
}
```

The configuration will try to connect to an AMQP message broker, using the
common configurations for Spring AMQP. The default setup will try to connect
to a local broker with the username and password `guest/guest`.
