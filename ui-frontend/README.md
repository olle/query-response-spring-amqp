# Query/Response UI

**WIP: Driving the goals and implementation of the UI with this README, please
feel free to provide feedback and ideas through issues.**

The Query/Response UI helps you gain insights and observe your active service
landscape by providing rich information about how queries and responses are
flowing throughout the system, in real-time.
